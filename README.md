# Stock-Market-Snippets

A collection of my small scripts (or code snippets only) used to analyze the stock market.

## Usage

Many of these Scripts could be used to feed Data into Boosting/Bagging algorithms for algo trading.
I mainly use them for manually analyzing macro movements in the market for sharing on reddit, twitter etc.

## Overview

### sectorsYTD

Small script that shows which sectors/groups of stocks performed YTD. 
The stocks in every manual bucket is equal weighted (not market cap.).
Returns Line chart. 1 = start value = 100% of original investment. 
0.8 = 80% of original investment = -20% YTD. etc.

### earningsNotification

A script that notifies me when one of my holdings has an earnings call in the upcoming week.
It uses a telegram bot and runs on a Raspberry Pi.
Schedule it to run on mondays 3:00AM via python scheduler or bash/batch.
Adjust tickers at very bottom.

### moonStocksCorrelation

Some lunatic (pun intended) on a forum claimed there was a correlation between the stock market and moon phases. Of course it is not true.
The moon is way to predictable and obvious for a self-fullfilling prophecy. It gets arbitraged away. You can try out different indices or timeframes.

### moon2electricboogaloo

Another claim about the moon was that specifically the 3rd day after a full moon is a good day on the market. 
```
Heute ist der 3. Börsentag NACH Vollmond.
Üblicherweise drehen die Börsenleute am 3. Börsentag nach Vollmond am meisten am Rad
```
And that the full moon in august "harvest moon" was something special.
```
Bezeichnenderweise heißt der August-Vollmond Erntemond
```
Especially regarding the standard deviation of a normal day on the stock market (and considering different indices) this is bs.
Idk why I wasted my time with this.

### correlationYTD

Analyzing the correlation of custom buckets of stocks with equal weight. Normally you'd expect gold or bonds a negative correlation with $SPY.
In some market environments a clear value <-> growth or global titans <-> small caps rotations can be identified.
